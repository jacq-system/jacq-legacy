The files and directories here have to be put in the root directory of the webserver (usually /srv/www/htdocs).

Some of them will be accessed by other scripts placed on other servers and will produce NO html-output whatsoever.
These are:
database/detail_server.php
database/inc/connect.php (a service file for detail_server.php)
database/json_rpc_scanPictures.php

Some of them are just normal php-scripts referenced to by various scripts in the input and output part.
These are:
api/copyImagesWithXML.php
api/copyWebImages.php
database/img/....   (everything)
